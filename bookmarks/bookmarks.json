The only thing stopping Chiaki from leaving for Europe is his fear of flying. As a result, he's grounded in Japan.  During his 4th year at Japan's top music university, Chiaki happens to meet Noda Megumi—or as she refers to herself, Nodame. On the surface, she seems to be an unkempt girl with no direction in life. However, when Chiaki hears Nodame play the piano for the first time, he is in awe at the kind of music she plays. To Chiaki's dismay, Nodame moves into the apartment next to his and finds out that she is head-over-heels in love with him.  Nodame Cantabile tells the story of Chiaki and Nodame, as they not only learn to deal with each other, but learn lessons from one another as they strive for the top of the musical world.

Since 1973, an invasion of aliens known as BETA upon Earth is driving human civilization into nearly collapse. Facing an enormous mass of enemy force, mankind has developed large humanoid arms called as Tactical Surface Fighters and deployed them to its defense lines through out the world. However, all those efforts could slow down defeats but could not stop BETA, and mankind is forced to abandon major area of the Eurasian Continent. For 30 years, mankind is bogged down in an endless war against BETA without any hopes of victory.  In 2001, the Imperial Japan faces difficulties in the development of a next-generation main Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF) as it defends the front lines of the Far East. The UN has proposed a joint development program between the Imperial Japan and the United States as a part of its international mutual development project of TSF, the Prominence Project.  Yui Takamura, a surface pilot of the Imperial Royal Guards of Japan, is given responsibility for the project and sets off to Alaska. Meanwhile, Yuya Bridges, also a surface pilot of the US Army, was heading to the same destination.  Yet they never knew that their encounter would change their destiny drastically.  This story with exciting human dramas and robot actions takes place in the development of a new Tactical Surface Fighters, the most important and effective weapons against BETA, at a crisis of human extinction.

In the far future, humans abandon a devastated Earth and traveled to outer space. However, due to unknown phenomenon that prevents them from traveling into space, humanity returns to Earth only to find it inhospitable except for Japan.   To accomodate the entire human population, pocket dimensions are created around Japan to house in the populace. In order to find a way to return to outer space, the humans began reenacting human history according to the Holy book Testament. But in the year 1413 of the Testament Era, the nations of the pocket dimensions invade and conquer Japan, dividing the territory into feudal fiefdoms and forcing the original inhabitants of Japan to leave.   It is now the year 1648 of the Testament Era, the refugees of Japan now live in the city ship Musashi, where it constantly travels around Japan while being watched by the Testament Union, the authority that runs the re-enactment of history. However, rumors of an apocalypse and war begins to spread when the Testament stops revealing what happens next after 1648.   Taking advantage of this situation, Toori Aoi, head of Musashi Ariadust Academy's Supreme Federation and President of the student council, leads his fellow classmates to use this opportunity to regain their homeland.

But what's a slacker to do when the radical new candidate for Student Council president announces her intent to get rid of clubs like the FRC? Well, getting the help of the current Student Council president is a good start, but HIS suggestion is so counter-intuitive that it's crazy: Yuki should run for the Student Council himself?

Hiko kills the raiding bandits in hopes of saving as many lives as possible, but only manages to spare one life from the massacre. Hiko leaves the child, advising him to go to the nearby village and have them take care of him. A few days later, as Hiko comes back to check upon the child he saved, he is shocked to see the child had created graves, both for the slaves he befriended and the bandits who killed them. Seeing potential in the young one, Hiko takes the child under his wing, names him Kenshin, meaning \"heart of sword,\" and teaches him about the art of swordsmanship under the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.  Struggling in a constant challenge with his ideal beliefs reflecting against the harshness of reality, Tsuiokuhen tells the melancholic and dark story of Himura Kenshin as one of the most feared assassins of the Japanese Revolution: the Hitokiri Battousai.

This course really made it easy to understand the how & why of redux. Thanks Dan!\n\n\nManaging state in an application is critical, and is often done haphazardly. Redux provides a state container for JavaScript applications that will help your applications behave consistently.\n\nRedux is an evolution of the ideas presented by Facebook's [Flux](https://egghead.io/articles/gentle-introduction-to-the-react-flux-architecture), avoiding the complexity found in Flux by looking to how applications are built with the Elm language.\n\nRedux is useful for React applications, but React is not a requirement!\n\nIn this series, we will learn the basics of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications. \n\nIt's highly recommended that you have a quick read of the [Redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html) alongside or before you watch the series.\n\nThere are some amazing [community notes on this course here on Github](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes).\n\nOnce you are finished with this course be sure to check out part 2: [building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux"},{"guid":"JcNu2p7Xofrc","title":"How to Build a Todo App Using React, Redux, and Immutable.js","index":3,"dateAdded":1477966468000000,"lastModified":1499305625000000,"id":3344,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Dan Prince shows how to build a Todo app using React, Redux, and Immutable.js."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-a-todo-app-using-react-redux-and-immutable-js/"},{"guid":"qQnk6aIp0Bp6","title":"Step by Step Guide To Building React Redux Apps – Medium","index":4,"dateAdded":1477966476000000,"lastModified":1499305625000000,"id":3345,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Redux is becoming the de facto way to build React apps.
